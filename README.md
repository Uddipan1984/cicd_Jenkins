# cicd_Jenkins
Test or POC to test CI/CD process with Jenkins. 
1. First we will test Maven build for simple web based Spring Boot project with Jenkins Pipe lines 
2. After build pipe line , we will add test case execution pipe line 
3. Pipe Line for artifact staging 
4. Pipe line for Deployment (Note - this is not ideal to do that , Better we will try later with Ansiable with Jenkins or Rundek)
